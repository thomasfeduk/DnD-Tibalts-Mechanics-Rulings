# Generic/Misc Rules

## Free actions:
- 1 simple object interaction per turn
  - Open door, drop/pickup item/weapon. Uncork something.
- Brief speech/chat/question
- Killing dragons of any CR

## Held Actions
- All held actions consume your reaction
- Attack Action: All attacks go off as if you took the attack action (ie 2 attacks for 5th lvl ranger)
- Spells: Spell slot is immediately consumed even if the trigger is never reched and concentration must be held. **(Need to discuss: Lets chat. I always thought this was shitty but we can keep it this way if people feel its mechanically balanced)**

# Spells

## Casting **(Need to finish)**
- Material component consumed...
- Cast vs casting vs casted...
- Interrupted vs counterspelled vs ???? ...
- Stored spells: Full casting time or action?
- I assume materials are spent when storing?

## Wall of Force (WOF):
- ### Teleportation:
  - #### **Can** teleport through WOF. (Misty step, dimension door, etc)
    - Must be a true disappear/reappear elsewhere type teleport. Not a teleport that **_physically traverses_** you quickly from point A-to-B.
    - **Cannot** move into it via the astral plane due to WOF extending to that plane.

- ### Anchoring:
  - Caster chooses to anchor **one point** (or the **_whole thing_**) to either a **fixed point in the air** or declared **body** (object/vessel/large mass) as desired.
    - e.g. : If on a ship, can anchor it to a fixed point on the deck of the ship, or the mast, or the side. Can anchor to the ground or cliff side. **(Needs to confirm)**
    - If anchored to a **fixed point in the air** while on a moving object, the WOF remains and will be "left behind" as the moving object continues onwards. If placed infront of the object, appropriate collision damage will occur as the object collides with it.
     - Declared body includes an **object** of any size. If a small pebble, then the Wall of Force can be swung around **but causes no damage beyond what the object would normally inflict**. Can be picked up and moved/laid down to cover a hole or doorway, but is only as heavy as the object it is attached to. **(Needs to confirm)**

- ### Spells and effects that manifest on the "other side" of the WOF
  - #### Non-AOE effects:
    - Spells that **manifest** on the other side of the WOF (from the caster's perspective) **manifest as norma**l.
            - i.e.: Sacred flame rains "down" from above the target. Chill touch manifests next to the target and squeezes it.

  - #### AOE effects
    - If they **don't** contain **physical manifestations** regardless of the point where they manifest, they will pass through the WOF. **(Needs to confirm: Do we hard rule no AOEs pass through, what about sound damage or sight damage AOEs?)**
      - ie darkness or sickening radiance next a sphere/WOF does make it go dark inside.
    - If the effect does contain **physical manifestations** (spike growth, sinking maw), then it only manifests on the side of the WOF where its origin point is chosen.

  - #### Sound/Sight
    - Follow same rules as **non-physical** AOE effects
      - i.e.you can turn to stone by looking at a medusa or take sound damage

  - #### Heat/cold
    - If **not physical, not magical** and **does not involve movement** (such as wind) damage occurs as normal **(Needs to confirm)**
      - e.g. Cold temperature still makes you take saving throws/take damage, arctic wind blasts or wind attacks do no damage, dragons cold breath cant "blow" across the barrier to deal damage. If an ice/fire monster has a 10' damage aura, it would still do damage. Lava nearby would still do damage.

  - #### Lightning effects
    - Magical: **(Need to discuss: I vote we consider this _physical traversal_)**
    - Non-magical: **(Need to discuss: I vote we consider this _physical traversal. This should follow leamons tiny hut ruling IMO_)**

  - #### Liquid/Water
    - Is considered **physical** so it cant pass through.
      - This includes magical equivalents. It includes mist/liquid/gas, dragons breath fire, acid.

## Leamon's Tiny Hut

- ### Can campfires be started inside??? What about a firebolt inside? **(Need to discuss)**

- ### Casting nuances
  - Does not break or require concentration to normal or ritual cast
  - Due to it not manifesting until the cast actually occurs, can begin ritual casting while inside

- ### Outside appearance
  - Can be solid opaque of choice, translucent/camoflauge to other side (DC perception check against caster's DC to notice it)
  - Cannot be changed once cast

- ### Known ways to enter or remove
  - Dispel magic: Full destruction of the hut
  - Anti-magic effects: Temporary **phase out** of the area impacted by the effect.
    - E.g. If a beholder anti-magic cone shines on half the dome, half the dome is still manifested.
    - Once the anti-magic effect is no longer present, the areas of the dome that were affected resume normal operations.

- ### Explicitly allowed to pass
  - Anything physical except for magical effects that were inside when cast
  - Things that appear inside after casting can leave, but once left entirely cannot return
    - E.g. Summon Galiel inside after cast, he can stick his finger out and pull it back.

- ### Shape
  - It is a hemisphere that has a bottom
    - Otherwise cold/heat damage would concur from ground

- ### Anchoring
  - Fixed in the air like WOF air anchoring rules
    - If the ground below is removed, then everything inside falls through the bottom since there is no ground and things that begin inside can pass through

- ### Follows all WOF rules with the following exceptions

  - #### Sounds
    - Caster chooses when cast if sound can pass and if so in which direction (or both). Cannot be changed once cast .
  - #### Sight/Visual
    - Caster chooses when cast **(Needs to confirm: Do we enable this to be changed?)**
    - Either:
      - If non-magical sound/sight effect occurs outside, affects creatures inside normally (that means sunlight can burn inside with a magnifying glass outside... But we need ot check on fires inside).
      - Nothing harmful outside hurts inside.
      - Non-magical shrieking can damage inside
